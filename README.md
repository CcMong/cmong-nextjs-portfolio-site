# Charles Mong Web Developer Portfolio Site

## Description

I wanted to create a more up-to-date web developer portfolio site using ReactJS. I decided to go one further and use the opportunity to get more familiar with a React framework. As a result, this portfolio site was built completely from scratch using NextJS and the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS. The latter allowed me to do the majority of my styling within the JSX markup, and I believe it is customisable, adaptable, and provides scope for potentially scaling an application relatively effortlessly.
